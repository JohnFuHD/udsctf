# Challenge 05 - When you know the answer

As a garage mechanic, you have access to the tools which allow you to unlock security modes within the ECUs that you test

Let's imagine you have observed one such transaction for session 0x60 and security level 3: when the ECU sends the seed `0x4b79` it unlocked to the key `0x4f4b`.

When this happens again, see if you can read DID 0x0005
