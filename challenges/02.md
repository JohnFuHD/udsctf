# Challenge 02 - Security Access

UDS provides a true security mechanism in which the Client can request a particular security level to unlock by engaging in what is 
called a Challenge/Response protocol in compute science circles.  For historical reasons, in the automotive world of UDS this is 
called "Seed&Key".  The Client requests a "Seed" (or "challenge" in computer science language) from which is calculates the "Key" (or "response").  
The Server will compare the "Key" with its expectation and unlock that security level.

There is some more detail - for example: https://udsoncan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/udsoncan/intro.html#sessions-and-security-levels

Access session 0x60, security level 3. For this level, the algorithm for mapping the UDS-Seed to the UDS-Key is to flip each bit.

Read DID 0x0002.
