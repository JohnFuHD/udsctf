# Challenge 20 - have code, will unlock.

It is not uncommon for the UDS unlocking procedure to be protected by a single algorithm with the algorithm also acting as key.  There is no
diversity of secrets across all instances of the ECU.  In this case, someone will eventually figure out the process and publish it.

This ECU replicates the method described for the "IC ECU" in https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Nie-Free-Fall-Hacking-Tesla-From-Wireless-To-CAN-Bus-wp.pdf.  To make life a little bit more challenging, in our case the seed is not static.
